NSNotificationCenter, KVO, KVC, MVC

This is a project that demonstrates a mechanisms of data exchange between model and controller objects in a MVC
design pattern. Here you can find usage of `NSNotificationCenter` as well as `KVO` (Key Value Observing) and
`KVC` (Key Value Coding).

The final project should contain a list of people as if it was a phonebook. User can specify name, surname, set some 
of preloaded images or delete existing as well as set the phone number and make a call if phone length is enough.
The first page also contains some counters of the phone book.
